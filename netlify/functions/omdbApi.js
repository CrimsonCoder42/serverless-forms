// Import fetch from node-fetch

/*
In Netlify serverless forms, you can use a Lambda function (like the handler function above) 
to process form submissions without the need for an external server. The Lambda function runs in 
the cloud and can be triggered by an HTTP request, such as a form submission.

When a form is submitted, the serverless function receives the form data as an event object. 
You can then process the form data within the function, such as validating input, saving data to a database, 
or sending an email notification. After processing the form data, the function can return a response to the 
client, such as a success message or an error message.

To set up a Netlify serverless function for handling form submissions, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file in the "functions" directory of your Netlify 
project. The file should export a handler function, like the one above.

2. In your HTML form, add a "data-netlify" attribute and set the form's "action" 
attribute to point to the serverless function's endpoint. For example, if your function 
is named "submitForm", the form's "action" attribute should be set to "/.netlify/functions/submitForm".

3. Deploy your Netlify project. When the form is submitted, the serverless function will be triggered and 
process the form data according to the code you've written in the handler function.

By using Netlify serverless forms, you can build and deploy web forms without the 
need for a dedicated server or back-end infrastructure, simplifying your development process and reducing costs.
